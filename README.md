Labs as part of Computer Networking course taught at IIT PKD. 

1. Write a TCP version of the `netcat` program in your favourite language.

2. Write a UDP version of `netcat` which sends each line in a separate
   UDP packet. Assume that the maximum length of each line is 1024
   bytes.

3. 	- Write a simple client that can make dns queries to any dns sever.
   and resolve the hostname to its ip address.

	- Write a simple dns server does the following: For every query to
   resolve the hostname `www.james.bond` returns the ip address
   `007.007.007.007`. Your name server should work with any program
   like `nslookup` not just your client in step 1.
